## Functionality

This is where we discuss how to use the software/app/etc.  For example, for our project 'MeDo':

* Currently, No Installation necessary.  Simply navigate to [the Medo webpage](https://mpaitgt.github.io/Medo-frontend/) to begin using.
* Google Chrome is our recommended web browser, but your preferred browser will work as well.
* User can input an artist/movie's name and add them to their respective list
* A list item will display the following:
    * The tile of the artist/band
    * The amount of time that has passed since the item was first added
    * A like button 
    * A removed button
